### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Mahbub E Sobhani
#### I am a web developer and Artificial Intelligence enthusiast.

I am a computer science & engineering student from United International University. Throughout my four years' journey I have learnt a lot of things, but I am very much enthusiastic about machine learning and artificial neural networks. I am also interested in the industry of software development and web development and trying to enhance my skills so that I can be well suited for the job sector. Currently, I am learning the Japanese language and having business manners to be a global candidate. I do like to solve programming problems. I am imaginative, inventive and skilled as well in my favourite areas. I like to participate in sports whenever I have the opportunity, but I love to spend my free time hiking through the mountains and walking around the sea.

Skills: LARAVEL / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS/ Neural Networks
